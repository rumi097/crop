CHAPTER 7
Testing, Results & Evaluation


7.1 Testing Strategy

The testing strategy combined manual functional testing with targeted automated checks for the backend.

Testing Types:
• Unit-like tests for selected backend endpoints (where scripts are available)
• Integration testing of complete user flows (login → action → verify result)
• UI testing by interacting with each portal in the browser
• Database testing using SQLite queries to verify persisted data

Available Test Scripts in Project:
• backend/test_server.py – basic server and route tests
• backend/test_all_features.py – high-level coverage across portals
• backend/test_portals_e2e.py – end-to-end portal integration checks
• backend/verify_all_portal_data.py – verification of critical portal fields and data
• backend/test_all_portals.sh and test_all_portal_fields.sh – shell scripts orchestrating broader checks

Test Environments:
• Local development environment with Flask dev server and React dev server
• Browsers: Chrome, Edge (or other modern browsers available on macOS)


7.2 Test Case Tables

Representative test cases are summarized below.

Table 7.1: Test Case Summary (Sample)

Authentication & Profile:
• TC-01: User registration with valid data → Expect success message and new user in DB
• TC-02: User registration with existing email → Expect error message
• TC-03: Login with valid credentials → Expect JWT token and user role
• TC-04: Login with invalid password → Expect error response
• TC-05: Fetch profile with valid token → Expect user and role-specific profile data
• TC-06: Update profile with valid data → Expect success, DB updated

Farmer Portal:
• TC-07: Create new crop listing with all fields (including location) → Listing appears in farmer view and public marketplace
• TC-08: Edit existing crop listing → Updated data reflected in UI and DB
• TC-09: Delete crop listing → Removed from marketplace and DB
• TC-10: Record cost entry → Cost record saved and visible in farmer cost table
• TC-11: Post labor job → Labor job appears in labor portal job list

Buyer Portal:
• TC-12: Browse marketplace → All active listings visible with correct farmer and location data
• TC-13: Add items to cart → Cart count and subtotal update correctly
• TC-14: Place order → Order created and visible to both buyer and farmer
• TC-15: Track order → Status updates are visible in buyer portal

Vendor Portal:
• TC-16: Create vendor product → Product appears in vendor product list and marketplace (if applicable)
• TC-17: Edit product details → Changes reflected in product list

Labor Portal:
• TC-18: View available jobs → Jobs posted by farmers appear
• TC-19: Apply for job → Application saved and visible in labor portal

Admin Portal:
• TC-20: View analytics dashboard → Counts match underlying database values
• TC-21: Deactivate user → Deactivated user no longer able to log in or access portal

ML Features:
• TC-22: Crop recommendation with valid parameters → Returns single recommended crop
• TC-23: Fertilizer recommendation → Returns recommended fertilizer list or description
• TC-24: Disease recognition with valid image → Returns probable disease label


7.3 Performance Evaluation

Performance was assessed primarily in the development environment, focusing on responsiveness rather than formal benchmarking.

Observed Metrics (Informal):
• Backend API response times typically under 300–500 ms for most operations
• Page navigation within React SPA almost instantaneous after initial load
• ML inference times: crop and fertilizer recommendations within ~200 ms, disease recognition slightly longer depending on model and image size

Scalability Considerations:
• SQLite is suitable for small to medium data volumes; for production scale, migration to PostgreSQL/MySQL is recommended
• Stateless JWT-based auth supports horizontal scaling of backend services

{Figure 7.1: Sample Performance Metrics Graph – response times vs endpoint}


7.4 Comparison with Baseline or Existing Systems

The project’s performance and feature set were compared qualitatively against:
• Traditional offline processes (manual trading, phone-based labor hiring)
• Simple online advertisement platforms (generic social media groups)

Key Improvements:
• Centralized view of all stakeholders and activities in one platform
• Clear and structured workflows instead of ad-hoc communications
• Persistent records of listings, orders, costs, and jobs
• ML-powered decision support features (crop, fertilizer, disease)

Table 7.3: System Comparison (Sample)

• Transaction tracking: Manual → Full digital records
• Transparency: Low → Higher (farmer identity, location, price visible)
• Decision support: None → ML-based recommendations
• Accessibility: Local → Online, accessible from anywhere with internet


7.5 Screenshots & Execution Results

Suggested Screenshots for the DOCX Report:
• Landing page showing public marketplace and navigation
• Login and registration pages for all roles
• Farmer dashboard showing summary cards and quick actions
• Farmer crop listing management view and add/edit form

CHAPTER 8
Discussion & Analysis


8.1 Interpretation of Findings

The completed system demonstrates that a multi-portal architecture can effectively represent complex real-world stakeholder interactions in the agricultural domain.

Key observations:
• Role-based portals provide clear separation of responsibilities and UI experiences
• Integrated marketplace significantly simplifies interactions between farmers, buyers, and vendors
• Inclusion of ML-based tools adds real value, making the system more than just a listing site
• Admin oversight ensures manageability and accountability within the platform


8.2 Strengths of the Project

• Comprehensive Scope:
  - Covers core agricultural workflows: selling crops, buying inputs, hiring labor, and administrative oversight

• Modular Architecture:
  - Clear separation of backend, frontend, and ML services
  - Easier to extend, maintain, and refactor individual components

• Practical Usability:
  - Interfaces designed with simple forms and clear labels suitable for non-technical users
  - Locations visible at listing level provide better context for buyers and logistics

• Educational Value:
  - Integrates multiple domains: web development, databases, security, and machine learning
  - Reflects real-world concerns and constraints


8.3 Limitations

• Deployment Environment:
  - Currently runs on development server setups rather than a hardened production environment

• Scaling Constraints:
  - SQLite suitable for small-scale deployments; production systems would need a more robust DB

• ML Model Scope:
  - Models trained on general datasets; real-world regional data could improve accuracy

• Feature Breadth vs Depth:
  - Many features implemented, but some (e.g., ratings, notifications, payments) are simplified or deferred for future work


8.4 Recommendations for Future Development

• Production-Ready Infrastructure:
  - Migrate to PostgreSQL or MySQL
  - Deploy on a cloud platform with proper HTTPS, monitoring, and backups

• Enhanced Automation:
  - Add automated test suites for both backend and frontend
  - Integrate CI/CD pipeline for deployments

• Advanced Features:
  - Implement in-app messaging between stakeholders
  - Introduce rating and review systems for farmers, vendors, and laborers
  - Add push notifications or email alerts for important events

• Data & Analytics:
  - Expand admin analytics to cover regional trends, demand forecasting, and crop performance
  - Add farmer-facing analytics dashboards for income and cost breakdowns


8.5 Reflection on Design & Implementation Decisions

In hindsight, several design decisions proved particularly beneficial:
• Early investment in a clean architecture made later extensions much easier
• Reusing shared components like ProfileEditor significantly reduced UI bugs
• Choosing JWT tokens worked well for a future-ready, API-first design

Trade-offs made:
• Some non-critical features were intentionally simplified to preserve project timeline
• Deep ML experimentation was limited in favor of stable integration

Overall, the chosen design strikes a balanced compromise between completeness, maintainability, and feasibility within the course constraints.
